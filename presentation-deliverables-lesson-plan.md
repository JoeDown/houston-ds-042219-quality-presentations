## Lesson Summary:

#### Topic:
Quality presentations: reviewing guidelines for slide decks and jupyter notebooks to set them up well for their presentations moving forward.

#### Learn.co material:
- None currently

#### Prerequisite knowledge/ Prework:
only having seen jupyter notebooks and slide decks before

### Learning goals for this lesson:

Students will be able to:
### Goal 1: Markdown:
- Adjust text in .ipynb to match markdown formatting of pre-existing deck.

### Goal 2: Slide Decks
- compare a good slide deck vs a bad slide deck through the steps of content, format, and style
- use a style guide create good content - generate guidelines for future deck creation

### Goal 3: Jupyter notebooks: 
- review good and bad jupyter notebooks
- Summarize the different purpose and format of a jupyter notebook given the stage of your analysis:
  - playing around jupyter notebook
  - presentation juptyter notebook
  - intermediate steps of making a nice function and realizing maybe you should call that function from a file

### Goal 4: Integrate these take aways into their mod1 presentation

## Misconceptions:
That all decks & notebooks are created equal

## Materials
- Two jupyter notebooks, one with markdown and one without
- Three jupyter notebooks demonstrating the different stages of notebook development
- Two slide decks to compare and contrast: [good](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vvnya28jwm7EBWDImB-easLgUZuW3Uj_gJSpTeITYnw/edit?usp=sharing) and [not so good](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i2_9VSOeX78UK6EGrUNnI9j4b7PPt_hia_8z1DWYju0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [markdown cheat sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

## Lesson Outline:

**Step**: Problem <br/>
**Time**: 

_Goal/Scenario:_<br/>
Tomorrow you will receive your first project assignment of this course. I will share all the specfic details quite soon, but before then it's safe to share that your project will involve creating a polished jupyter notebook of your analysis and a slide deck of your findings. We want to get you practicing good deck and notebook habits as soon as possible, so that every project in your github repo looks great and that you are well marketed to employers. 

_Learning Goals in sequence:_<br/>
- Assess a few presentation decks and generate a list of best practices
- Practice formating text in markdown
- Identify the differences between jupyter notebooks in different stages of analysis
- Identify your growth area in presentations and generate a list of steps

**Step**: Activation <br/>
**Time**: 

Who here has ever seen a bad presentation? Tell me what it was like
[write down common factors on the board]
Now, tell me about the best presentations you've seen. What were they like?
[write on board]

Okay, so we see some common differences.


**Step**: Learning Goal 1:  Slide decks <br/>

_Demonstrate_: <br/>
- we alredy generated a list of good/bad presentation qualities at the beginning and many of them have to do with decks
- Take a few minutes to review these two decks and write down what you like/don't like about each of them with a partner
- Ask them first about **content**, then **format**, and **style*
- write down notes for each

_Application_: <br/>
- What's a list of best practices we can create based off of these findings?

**Step**: Learning Goal 2:  Practice formating text in markdown <br/>

_Demonstrate_: <br/>
- guide them through reviewing two notebooks
- which is easier to read?
- demo updating one of the features

_Application_: <br/>
Have students update remainder of formatting using the cheat sheet and the original document

_Informal assessment_: <br/>
What are some items you could improve on your github readme using markdown?





**Step**: Learning Goal 3:  review jupyter notebooks <br/>

_Demonstrate_: <br/>
When you write a paper or a report, what version do you share with your boss or your audience? Does it look different than when you started?
- We have three notebooks and note their differences and similarities
- please review them and order them from lowest to highest 1 being just for your eyes and 3 being for an audience

_Application_: <br/>
- Summarize the different purpose and format of a jupyter notebook given the stage of your analysis:
  - playing around jupyter notebook
  - presentation juptyter notebook
  - intermediate steps of making a nice function and realizing maybe you should call that function from a file

_Informal assessment_: <br/>
Which morning exercises have we practiced the skills you need to make your notebook be in the expected format?


**Step**: Integration:  Identify your growth area in presentations and generate a list of steps <br/>
**Time**: 

_Synthesis_: <br/>
so we reviewed:
- markdown
- slide decks
- talked a bit about presentation
- identified qualities of a good final product jupyter notebook

_Application_: <br/>
The integration for this lesson will happen as you create your mod1 project materials and deliver them.
What's the one area you see in yourself that will need the most focus, where you will be experiencing the most growth?


**Step**: Assessment:  <br/>
**Time**: 

- review questions through kaboot
- but mostly this will be during presentations

**Step**: Reflection:  <br/>
**Time**: 

Small reflection of reaction to training. Will provide  bank of these questions on teacher training wiki.
